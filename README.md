## AI VISUAL QUALITY CONTROLLER

# Automated quality control tool for industry

The AI Visual Quality Controller (AIVQC) is an innovative system designed to detect defective medical dressings on a production line automatically. Utilising a custom-trained object detection model based on the YOLOv4 architecture, the AIVQC can identify various defect types, including foreign bodies, red tape, and cuts. The system leverages the powerful and efficient Darknet framework and the OpenCV library for image pre-processing and camera feed acquisition. The user interface ensures an intuitive and user-friendly experience for operators, allowing easy threshold adjustments and real-time monitoring of the detection process. Although initially developed for medical dressings, the AIVQC has the potential to detect a wider range of defects and be applied to various products across the industry. Future work may include incorporating additional defect classes, integrating with production line sensors and actuators, and further optimising the system for higher frame rates to accommodate increased production speeds. The AIVQC demonstrates a promising approach to improving quality control in the manufacturing sector and has the potential to contribute significantly to the industry’s ongoing efforts toward automation and enhanced efficiency.
